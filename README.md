Uploading parts based on youtube videos.

Each part has new code (overrwrites last part!)

If upgrading, delete old code.

To install, copy files to the "assets" folder of a new unity project.

Follow tutorials to set tags & layers as well as understand the project & code. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLarxIB7wVp2qLqS9EmZQ-YKxzvl8M-Vrs
